## Picture-Similarity: a picture similarity test project. Functions: uploading pictures,cutting out the items in the picture, and comparing the similarity of the pictures. 
## Project description：
  The application is a picture similarity test project based on the Java spring. It provides the following functions: uploading pictures, cutting out the items in the picture, and comparing the similarity of the pictures. The application creates a Restful API for image uploading based on the Java Spring, uses OpenCV for image processing, and combines two methods of image similarity testing to test the similarity of pictures (it can increase the accuracy of the test). The application does not use the database, uploaded pictures are stored directly on the file system.
## Environment：
  It runs atop a laptop having an Intel Core i7 CPU at 2.70GHz and 8.00G of RAM, running 64-bit operating system.
## Version of the installation software：
  Eclipse 4.8.0 (Photon)    
  Tomcat 9.0   
  OpenCV 3.4.1

  Eclipse: Https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html     
  Tomcat: Http://tomcat.apache.org     
  OpenCV: Https://opencv.org/opencv-3-4-1.html
## How to run it：
  You can open the project in Eclipse then run the SpringRestPicUpload-Similarity\src\main\webapp\uploadMultiple.jsp.
The result is like this:
<div align=center><img width="380" height="250" src="https://github.com/Northeastern-University-Blockchain/Picture-Similarity/blob/master/img-folder/Pic1.png"/></div> 

  Upload pictures that you want to compare, thumbnails will be shown on the page.
<div align=center><img width="380" height="360" src="https://github.com/Northeastern-University-Blockchain/Picture-Similarity/blob/master/img-folder/Pic2.png"/></div> 

Cropped picture and uploaded pictures will be stored directly on the file system.
<div align=center><img width="380" height="240" src="https://github.com/Northeastern-University-Blockchain/Picture-Similarity/blob/master/img-folder/Pic4.png"/></div>

  Click the upload button, you will get the results.
